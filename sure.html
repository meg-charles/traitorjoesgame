    <p>You take the sample.</p>
    <p>The employee stares into your eyes, but their gaze drifts deeper, carving its way into your soul.</p>
    <p>Your stomach starts to churn, and you start to pass out. The last thing you remember as your head 
      hits the floor is catching a glimpse under the storage doors swinging into the Trader Joe’s back room.</p>
    <p>You see a few streaks of blood on the ground, but that isn’t what shakes you the most. 
      The floor is covered with thousands of used free-sample cups.</p>
