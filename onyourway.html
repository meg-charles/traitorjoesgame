    <p>You’re on your way to Trader Joes for a munchie-run. It is currently 9:15pm. You have 45 minutes before the store closes.</p>
    <p>The layout is a labyrinth of narrow aisles and haphazardly stacked shelves. It’s as if they think messiness equates to authenticity. 
    Every corner is crammed with an excessive amount of bizarre, off-brand products that you never knew you didn’t need. 
    From “Not-Your-Average Joe’s” Peanut Butter to “Organic-Enough” Cereal, it’s a showcase of their quirky, offbeat branding.</p>
    <p>The employees are all dressed in those tropical Hawaiian shirts as if they’re on a perpetual vacation.
    They insist on starting conversations with you as if you’re long-lost friends. 
    It’s not the kind of small talk you want while you’re on a mission to find a specific item before closing time.</p>
    <p>Good luck trying to get through the throngs of shoppers who are just as bewildered as you. 
    Trader Joe’s may have its loyal following, but as far as you’re concerned, it’s a circus of chaos, 
    where the only thing you’re eager to escape is the store itself.</p>
    <p>Here are the aisles that are closest to you: </p>
