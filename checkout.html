    <p>You're ushered to the front. It's absolutely barren. Not a single other soul in the building.
    Joe starts ringing you up.</p>
    <p>"Oh, these look like some great snacks for your friends. Are you sure this is
    exactly what they wanted?"</p>
    <p>You look up from pulling out your wallet to see Joe has a terrifying grin on his face. 
    It looks like there's far too many teeth in his mouth. Before you can react, his shoulders are 
    hunched and he lunges over the counter at you!</p>
