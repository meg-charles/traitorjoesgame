    <p>You stand in your dimly lit dorm room, the clock ticking down to 9:00 pm, 
      and your heart pounding like a drum. Your new friends at college are 
      everything you've ever wanted. They're cool, funny, and they actually like you-
      -a vast improvement from your high school experience. 
    <p>Shane, one of your newfound buddies, bursts into your room with a messy, 
      almost illegible map and an air of urgency, your palms start to sweat, 
      and you can feel your nervousness intensifying.</p>
    <p>He has a job for you...</p>
    <p><a href="dimwit.html">Grab the map and go, no questions asked. - You don't want to waste a second.</a></p>
