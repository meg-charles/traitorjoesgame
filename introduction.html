    <p>The sign looms above you in that Jimmy Buffet
      style font,and something in you feels anxious.
      Maybe it's because Shanesent you to get stuff
      right before the store closed.
      Maybe it's because you want this night
      with Chelsea to go really well.
      Who are you kidding? Of course you want
      it to go well!
    <p>The parking lot is still packed with people
      despite it being fifteen minutes to closing.
      If you stand here any longer, the workers
      might call the cops. What should you do?
