    <p>You, too, have been drawn into the whimsical world of floral investment. 
      Armed with your smartphone and the knowledge of making the right choice to 
      impress Chelsea, you dive into the aisles with determination. You find yourself examining the flowers 
      with the precision of a seasoned stock trader. The choices range from traditional 
      options like red roses to more exotic picks with names you can barely pronounce.</p>
    <p>Your smartphone becomes your trading terminal, as you snap pictures and post them 
      on reddit for approval from self-proclaimed heartbreakers, just as traders seek 
      advice from their financial analysts. You overhear snippets of conversations from 
      your fellow flower investors, discussing the potential return on investment in each 
      bouquet.</p>
    <p>“Do you think Chelsea prefers a bouquet with baby’s breath or without?” or 
      “Which bloom has the highest ‘impressiveness’ rating?” are the questions that fill 
      the air, transforming the flower aisle into a parody of the stock exchange floor. 
      The whole scene is nothing short of comical, with shoppers unwittingly turning flower 
      selection into a Wall Street-inspired frenzy. And there you stand, a flower investor 
      in a market you never anticipated participating in. The stakes are high.</p>
    <p>Shit, it’s been nearly 20 minutes. We need to hurry up. </p>
