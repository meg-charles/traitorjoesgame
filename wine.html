    <p>The wine section at Trader Joe’s, a labyrinth of bottles and labels 
      where the casual shopper and the wine aficionado alike find themselves 
      in a realm of endless choices and eccentric options. As you approach 
      the wine shelves, you find yourself pondering which bottle to choose 
      for Chelsea. You take a moment to consider the options:</p>
    <p>Choice #1: A Bottle of Rosé - A light, summery choice that could 
      potentially match Chelsea’s cheerful personality. It looks cute and 
      inviting, but you can’t help but wonder if it’s a bit too cliché for a 
      college party.</p>
    <p>Choice #2: A Bottle of Chardonnay - A classic, upscale option that 
      may convey a sense of sophistication. You imagine Chelsea sipping on 
      it with a satisfied smile, but is it too serious for a college gathering?</p>
    <p><a href="rose.html"> Rosé for sure. </a></p>
    <p><a href="chardonnay.html"> Chardonnay for a classy lady. </a></p>
