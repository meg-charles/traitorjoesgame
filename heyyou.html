    <p>"Hey! What do you think you're doing!?"</p>
    <p>A team employee runs up to you. "We're closing, make your way to the checkout please."</p>
    <p>Before you can respond, which would be in around 30 seconds due to your crippling anxiety, 
      another team member saunters his way over. Unlike the other employees, this one has no 
      name tag, and a smile that you can't describe as anything other than murderously charismatic. 
      The sheer presence of this worker is enough to make the first employee's eyes go wide.</p> 
    <p>"Have a free sample," the second employee insists to the impatient worker, nearly neglecting 
      your entire existance.</p>
    <p>He slowly shoves the paper cup toward the employee, who slurps it up slowly. The charismatic 
      worker closes his eyes, and whispers into the other's ear an orgasmic... 
      "Mmmmmhmm yes. That's better, isn't it."</p>
    <p>You decide to break up the moment.</p>
    <p><a href="walk.html"> Well I guess it's time for me to head out!</p>
