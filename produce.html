    <p>As you contemplate your choices in the produce aisle, a Trader Joe’s team member 
      approaches, pushing a free sample your way. But there’s something slightly off 
      about their demeanor. Their too-wide grin and overly eager tone give you the feeling 
      that they’re just a tad too enthusiastic. Their eyes linger on you for a moment too 
      long, and their smile remains fixed in an unsettling way.</p>
    <p>You wish Chelsea would look at you like that.</p>
    <p>“Would you like a free sample?”</p>
    <p>The free sample they offer is a dish of something strange and 
      unfamiliar, and their insistence that you try it borders on uncomfortable.</p>
