    <p>The snack aisle at Trader Joe’s, a realm of endless possibilities 
      for those with a questionable palate. It’s a treasure trove of 
      unconventional treats and an assortment of quirky options that may 
      leave you both delighted and perplexed.</p>
    <p>As you approach the snack section, you’re met with rows upon rows 
      of snacks that seem to defy convention. There are chips with flavors 
      you never thought existed, like “wasabi ginger” or “sriracha barbecue.”</p>
    <p>***Footnote*** The cookies, crackers, and sweet treats are no less 
      eccentric. You’ll find chocolate-covered potato chips and cookies that 
      claim to be healthier due to obscure ingredients like “ancient grains.” 
      If you’re looking for a straightforward bag of plain potato chips or 
      regular chocolate chip cookies, you might be out of luck.
    <p>***Don’t even attempt to dine on any of the eclectic popcorn choices, ranging 
      from “truffle toffee” to “dill pickle.”</p>
    <p>What items do you think Shane and Chelsea would like for the party?</p>
    <p><a href="puffsxl.html"> You remember Shane liking those corn puffs! Go with that.</a></p>
    <p><a href="ranch.html"> Maybe Shane likes ranch?? As a snack?? Maybe you don't know these people
    like you think you do.</a></p>
