    <p>“Oh, ain’t no prob” Shane walks out of the room, his lanky walk tells 
      you that he’s already got a start on get-lit Friday. You can hear him 
      start crying from the other side of the wall.</p>
    <p>“Hey, you okay?” Chelsea runs into Shane as he sulks away.
      Chelsea storms into the room. "What did you do to him? </p>
    <p><a href="takelist.html"> "Forgot about get-lit Friday."</a></p>
    <p><a href="outgoing.html"> "I’m not the most outgoing person, 
      and in high school, I didn’t have many friends. But here, in college, 
      I’ve got this opportunity to start fresh, to be someone new. And I want 
      to be someone you would notice, someone you’d want to be around. 
      You're the kind of person I can’t help but admire. I can’t even begin 
      to describe how it feels when you looks my way, laughs at my jokes, 
      or give me that encouraging nod. It’s like my heart skips a beat every 
      time. And now, I’ve got this chance to impress you, to show you that I 
      can be the kind of person you’d want to be friends with. 
      Maybe even more than friends..</a></p>
