    <p>Shane’s voice echoes in your head.</p>
    <p>“Choose wisely, or we’ll never be friends with you again.”</p>
    <p>Wait... maybe this was your voice, not Shane’s.</p>
    <p>In Shane’s disorientation, he must have forgotten to write down 
      a shopping list and instead drew a map of where to get the items. 
      It’s hideously illegible. </p>
