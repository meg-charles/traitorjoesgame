    <p>The bread section at Trader Joe’s, where simplicity goes to die. 
      It’s an area where you’ll find an impressive array of bread, but 
      it’s also where things tend to get a little more complicated than 
      they need to be. As you approach the bread shelves, you’re immediately 
      greeted by a hodgepodge of baguettes, ciabattas, and whole-grain loaves.</p>
    <p>To top it off, there’s a team member offering samples, which may be 
      delightful for some but can make a quick trip to grab a loaf of bread 
      feel like a prolonged shopping experience.</p>
    <p>“Would you like a free sample?”</p>
